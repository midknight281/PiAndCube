Programming Rasberry Pi to control a arduino cube

The plan for the project is to have a Rainbowduino Cube 4X4 controlled by a rasberry pi.
I can currently have a rasberry pi power a cube and a wifi
I hope to have the RasberryPi check a weather RSS and send a message to the Raindowduino the device would then graphically display the weather.

Dependents
  Currently the only dependents are the Raindowduino libraries.
  I am looking at adding the oncommand libraries.
